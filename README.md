# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Hand Gesture Recognition model to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Features
- CNN Model: Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train the model for recognizing hand gestures. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks and excel at learning hierarchical features.

- Gesture Classification: Trained the model to classify various hand gestures, providing a diverse range of commands for human-computer interaction.

- OpenCV Integration: Incorporated OpenCV for real-time video capture and testing. This allows seamless integration with camera devices and enables testing the model's performance in a dynamic environment.
